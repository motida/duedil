Use a cache for holding previous calculated matchings, possibly an LRU cache.
Maybe use python implementation of LRU. (See: @functools.lru_cache(user_function) )
or Redis.

Another possible solution is to pre-calculate the matching for each company and hold the
matching company id and the match score.

If a ‘new company’ comes along that is not in companies list calculate the result on the fly and
save the company name and id for future recalculations of data set
However this solution will ‘work’ only if threshold provided<=match_score
otherwise will need calculate on the fly.
Might also put the companies data in external storage/database (Example: S3 files/Postgres table
etc.) and read the data by chunks.

Another alternative is to push input data as a temporary table to database and calculate result
directly on database using a complex SQL query.
